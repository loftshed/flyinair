> # FLYINAIR

A basic airline booking system produced as part of the Concordia Bootcamps Full-Stack Web Development program. This was the first time I got to use MongoDB for a real project. For this project, we were tasked with finishing a hypothetical delinquent ex-employee's code-- a super broken, suuuper ugly skeleton of a site, and a component with a seat grid.
